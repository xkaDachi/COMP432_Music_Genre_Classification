\section{Abstract}
    \paragraph{}
    We perform music genre classification manually using our own understanding of music. Methods that take into account conventional algorithmic approaches have not yet been developed since the distinctions between genres tend to be subjective and ill-defined. By observing and making predictions based on these ill-defined patterns, machine learning can observe and make predictions given enough audio data, of which large amounts can easily be harvested from online music. In this project, we aim to develop a music genre classifier that will accurately predict a song's genre by using a deep learning approach. Specifically, we will train two different models using two types of neural network architectures, namely, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Python is used with a machine learning package: Tensorflow.keras to build our two models. We will compare and determine our best model through each of their accuracies.
