# BitByteBeat: The Music Genre Classification Bot
This repository contains our src code for the COMP432 Machine Learning Project. The purpose of this project was to familiarize the group with working on a machine learning project and to get practical application skills.


## Dataset
Our dataset comes from the [GTZAN Dataset - Music Genre Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification/) which is a popular public dataset for music genre recognition (MGR). This is a 1.41 GB folder containing training data that was used to train our models. The particular folder of interest was the Data/genres_original as it contained a collection of 10 genres with 100 audio (.wav) files each. These files were all 30 seconds in length. The 10 genres within this set are:
1. blues
2. classical
3. country
4. disco
5. hiphop
6. jazz
7. metal
8. pop
9. reggae
10. rock

We would like to note that sample 54 within the jazz set was discarded when training the models as the file was corrupted.


## Installation
```console
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## Jupyter Notebook
- run the `Music Classification.ipynb` file from a Jupyter Notebook


## Running the program from Terminal
- cd into the repo's root directory
- open a terminal emulator of your choice
- run preprocessing
```console
python3 preprocessing.py
```
- run both convolution neural network and recurrent neural network models
```console
$ python3 convolutional_neural_network.py & python3 recurrent_neural_network.py
```
- program provides output to the screen as well as data given within the output folder for each task respectively
